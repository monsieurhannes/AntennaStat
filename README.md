Analysis of AntennaPod database

# Usage

`git copy` the repository and place the exported database file as `"AntennaPodBackup.db"` in the directory above the git repository. Otherwise you need to change the code. Future file-opening dialogue is in planning.

# To Do
- [ ] "Open file" dialogue to pick individual files
- [ ] Get [dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) or something else going
- [ ] Pack everything to a useful package
- [ ] Research possibilities to integrate it in AntennaPod directly
